  about: >-
    I love to help people solve their problems in IT and make the world step forward towards a brighter future.
    I took courses about the human brain, neural links, which helps me learn in the most effective way.
    My language skills include Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, English. This helps me consume information from multiple sources.
    I am an active person – I ride my bicycle every day, try to walk more than 5km per day and take frequent breaks while developing.
