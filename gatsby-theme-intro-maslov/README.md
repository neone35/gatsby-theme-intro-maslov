## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Install theme & dependencies

```shell
mkdir my-site
cd my-site
yarn init -y
yarn add gatsby react react-dom @arturthemaslov/gatsby-theme-intro-maslov
```

### Enable theme

Then add the theme to your `gatsby-config.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@arturthemaslov/gatsby-theme-intro-maslov",
      options: {
        theme: "classic",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

### Run your site

That's it, you can now run your site using

```shell
gatsby develop

### Edit content
