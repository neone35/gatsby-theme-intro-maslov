  about: >-
    Certified mobile developer with interdisciplinary knowledge.
    This helps to generate new ideas and come up with original solutions.
    For example, had my own bicycle repair business. I speak, read & write in 4 languages - english, lithuanian, russian, polish.
    This helps to widen my information input from various sources. I love reading scientific and psychology books in my free time.
    I am active person – I ride bicycle every day, walk more than 5km per day and take frequent brakes while developing.
    INTP character type - analytical, curious, original.
