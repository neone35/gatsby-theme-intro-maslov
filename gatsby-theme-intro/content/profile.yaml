  about: |
    I am a highly motivated person. My idol is Elon Musk. He is exceptionally straightforward and never gives
            up. I have a high pain threshold to solve important problems. During my childhood I solved problems with
            lego bricks and drew lots of mechanical creations. My language skills include Russian, Polish, Lithuanian,
            English. This helps me consume information from multiple sources. I love to help people solve their problems
            in IT and make the world step forward faster towards a brighter future. I took courses about the human
            brain, neural links, which helps me learn in the most effective way. I am an active person – I ride my
            bicycle every day, try to walk more than 5km per day and take frequent breaks while developing.
